/**
 * The Heading class represents a reStructuredText Heading element. Headings can contain any body element, transitions,
 * or subheadings. Headings are the standard of content division in reStructuredText as they are in many kinds of text-based
 * content. ReStructuredText Headings also serve as implicit link targets in a table of contents or possibly inline 
 * references. Bordering and nesting of Headings is automatically handled. From highest level to lowest level, the bordering
 * standard is given by the following character order:
 *    # * = - ^ " ' : . / ; \ , ` [ { ( < + _ $ % & @ ? ! ] } ) >
 *
 * The first two will be over-lined as well, so a sample Heading tree:
 * Top Heading
 *
 *     Lower Heading
 *
 *         Third Heading
 *
 *             Fourth Heading
 *
 *         Same level as Third Heading
 *
 * would look like this:
 *
 * ###########
 * Top Heading
 * ###########
 *
 * *************
 * Lower Heading
 * *************
 *
 * Third Heading
 * =============
 *
 * Fourth Heading
 * --------------
 *
 * Same level as Third Heading
 * ===========================
